## Learning Outcomes
-   Explain why we use RMarkdown & knit to PDF
-   Navigate YAML & use it to enhance to your documents
-   Control how *code* appears in knit output:\
    code chunk settings
-   Control how *text* appears in knit output:\
    markdown techniques
-   Understand the knitting process and\
    how it converts Rmd to PDF, HTML, etc.

## Use of RStudio & RMarkdown so far...
-   We have provided you with Rmd files
-   Write/edit code (code chunks)
-   Document that code (text blocks)
-   Generate PDFs of code and its outputs
-   Integrate with Git/GitHub for version control

notes: we mostly worked with already given rmd documents

## Advantanges of RMarkdown
### Why do we use RMarkdown?
-   Written in basic text (fully reproducible)
-   Works well with version control
-   Allows for code and documentation in one file
-   When knit, can produce tidy output in many file formats
Notes: dont need any specific software, raw text, good for 
reproducibility. can generate a lot of documents

## RMarkdown: A deeper look
### The three components of RMarkdown
-   YAML
-   Text (markdown)
-   Code (R or ???)

## YAML: What is it?
-   "Yet another markdown language"\
    "YAML ain't markdown language"
-   Always at the beginning of an Rmd
-   Enclosed by three dashes `---`
-   Includes instructions applied when knitting
-   Instructions take the form of `key`:`value` pairs
Notes: that bit at the start, knitting instructions, 
form of key value pairs. example "title:'something'"
also gives what the output type is 

## YAML, An Exercise
1.  Create a new Rmd in R
2.  Set the title, author, date
3.  Set output to be PDF
4.  View the YAML in the Rmd produced
5.  Knit the document & view the PDF
6.  Add new entries:
    -   `subtitle: "A draft copy"`
    -   `toc: true`
7.  Add a few markdown headers (`##`)
8.  Knit and view...
notes: creates pdf, title, name, and title. 6 adds a subtitle and 
table of contents 
"##" - header
"###" - subheader
"+" - subbullet

## YAML, A Recap
-   YAML setting apply to the entire document
-   YAML is read in the knit process
-   YAML has even more advanced settings\
    [Markdown Cheat sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/rmarkdown.pdf)\
    <https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/pdf-document.html>
notes: cheat sheet has a lot of helpful info

## The knitting process
-   The knitting sequence [![image link](img/rmarkdownflow.png)](https://env872.github.io/assets/images/rmarkdownflow.png)
-   `Rmd`→[*knitr*]→`md`:\
    Guided by instructions in YAML & Code chunks
-   `md`→[*Pandoc*]→`PDF`:\
    Markdown translated into PDF\|HTML\|Word\|... by Pandoc
-   Example...
notes: what happens when you knit a doc? knitting engages 
knitir,a package that deals with rmd. then becomes general
markdown pandoc then takes that and makes it into a file.  

## Code Chunks: Recap
-   Where code is executed
-   Surrounded by triplets of tics: ```` ``` ````
-   Chunks have attributes, set within `{  }`\
    For example: `{r plot AQI, echo=FALSE}`
notes: attributes, first what language then name of code chunk
then it can have other mods, can set other languages but need 
to have them downloaded

## Code Chunks: Example
-   Shortcuts to create
-   Coding languages
-   Setting chunk attributes
    - <https://yihui.org/knitr/options/#chunk-options>
    - <https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/r-code.html>
-   Global code chunk attributes\
    `knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)`
Notes: in brackets can set what prints and doesn't, what does
what in the the cheat sheet. 
echo=FALSE - doesnt show the code just output
include=FALSE - doesnt show output or the code
eval=FALSE - dont run
    
## Code Chunks: Plots and Figures
-   `fig.cap`: Set figure Caption
-   `fig.width`, `fig.height`: Set figure size, or...
-   `fig.dim` to set both (e.g. `fig.dim = c(5,3)`)
-   `out.width`, `out.height`: scale figs in output docs\
    e.g. `out.width=80%` to set at 80% of page width
-   `fig.align`: set alignment (`left', 'center', etc.)
Notes: can set size - more relevant for knitting. fig cap 
gives caption and auto numbers the figures. but if you put 
it in chunk then they will give all the ones in the same chunk
the same caption. to give different ones each in own chunk.

## Markdown: Recap
###   Common stylings:
-   `#`: headings
-   `>`: block quotes
-   Ordered and unordered lists...
-   Hyperlinks...
notes: ordered lists can be done with 1. thing
needs to have the space. unordered can be done with * or -,
sub bullets by + 
clickable link [link name](web address)
can edit template to make it look different
 

## Markdown: Documentation
-   Quick reference
-   Cheatsheet
-   Reference Guide

## Markdown: Exercises
-   Creating tables
-   Inserting images
-   Additional text formatting
notes: images done with ![image link](path to image)
can do file online, but struggles to knit to pdf then 

## Markdown: Useful techniques
-   `\newpage`
-   `\listoftables`
-   `\listoffigurres`
-   `---`
-   Using the *Visual Editor*!
note: vistual shows it a clearer format sometimes but
can update code to its defaults 

## Pretty tables with `kable`
-   Part of the `knitr` package
-   Convert a dataframe to a markdown table\
    Makes for aethetic output
-   Example...
notes: can also add column names or a caption

## Exercises!
-   Open `06_LakeReport.Rmd` and knit as is
-   Add a table of contents
-   Set the first code chunk to run, but:
    -  code is not shown in knit output
    -  warnings are not shown in output
